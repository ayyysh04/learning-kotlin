Q.is single app multiple fragment better than multiple activity and why ?
Using a single activity with multiple fragments is generally considered a better approach than using multiple activities in an Android app, for several reasons:

1.Improved performance: In Android, creating a new activity is a relatively expensive operation, as it involves launching a new process, initializing the activity, and inflating the layout. On the other hand, switching between fragments within a single activity is much faster, as the activity is already loaded and running.

2.Easier navigation: With a single activity and multiple fragments, you can use the Navigation Component to create a navigation graph that defines the flow between different screens in your app. This makes it easier to manage the navigation stack and handle back button presses, as the system automatically manages the fragment back stack.

3.Modular design: When using multiple fragments in a single activity, each fragment can be thought of as a modular component that can be added or removed as needed. This makes it easier to organize your code and reuse components across different screens in your app.

4.Better memory management: Since fragments are part of the same activity, they share the same lifecycle and can easily communicate with each other. This allows you to manage memory more efficiently, as you can unload fragments that are not currently in use to free up resources.

5.Easier to implement complex layouts: With a single activity and multiple fragments, you can create complex layouts by combining different fragments into a single screen. This allows you to reuse common UI components and create more flexible and responsive layouts.

Overall, using a single activity with multiple fragments is a better approach for most Android apps, as it provides better performance, easier navigation, and more modular design. However, there may be cases where using multiple activities is more appropriate, such as when you have separate entry points into your app or need to create a completely separate user experience for a specific feature.
