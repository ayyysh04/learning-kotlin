->To show a notification in Kotlin, you can follow these steps:

1.Create a notification channel: Notification channels are used to group notifications together. You need to create a notification channel before showing a notification.

val channelId = "my_channel_01"
val channelName = "My Channel"
val importance = NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_HIGH

val channel = NotificationChannel(channelId, channelName, importance)
val notificationManager = getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE) as NotificationManager
notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(channel)

2.Create a notification builder: A notification builder is used to set the content of the notification.

val builder = NotificationCompat.Builder(this, channelId)
    .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_icon)
    .setContentTitle("My notification title")
    .setContentText("This is my notification content.")
    .setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_HIGH)

3.Show the notification: To show the notification, you need to call the notify() method on the NotificationManager.

val notificationId = 1
notificationManager.notify(notificationId, builder.build())


The full code would look something like this:

val channelId = "my_channel_01"
val channelName = "My Channel"
val importance = NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_HIGH

val channel = NotificationChannel(channelId, channelName, importance)
val notificationManager = getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE) as NotificationManager
notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(channel)

val builder = NotificationCompat.Builder(this, channelId)
    .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_icon)
    .setContentTitle("My notification title")
    .setContentText("This is my notification content.")
    .setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_HIGH)

val notificationId = 1
notificationManager.notify(notificationId, builder.build())

Note: Make sure to replace R.drawable.notification_icon with your own notification icon.
