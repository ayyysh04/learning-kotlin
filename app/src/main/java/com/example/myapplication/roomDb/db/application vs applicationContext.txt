In Android, Application and ApplicationContext are both important classes, but they serve different purposes.

Application is a base class for maintaining global application state. It's a subclass of Context and provides access to the application-level resources and services. The Application class is created when the application starts and it's destroyed when the application is stopped. You can use the Application class to initialize global resources, such as a database connection, or to register global callbacks, such as UncaughtExceptionHandler.

Here's an example of how to create a custom Application class:

class MyApp : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        // Initialize global resources
        Database.init(this)

        // Register global callbacks
        Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler { thread, throwable ->
            // Handle uncaught exceptions
        }
    }
}
ApplicationContext, on the other hand, is a context of the application that's attached to the Activity context. It's a global context provided by the system and is used to access application-level resources and services. Unlike the Application class, the ApplicationContext is created when the application starts and remains available throughout the lifetime of the application.

Here's an example of how to use ApplicationContext:

val packageName = applicationContext.packageName
val sharedPreferences = applicationContext.getSharedPreferences("myPrefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
In this example, we're accessing the package name and shared preferences of the application using the applicationContext.

In summary, Application and ApplicationContext are both important classes in Android, but they serve different purposes. The Application class is used to maintain global application state and provides access to application-level resources and services. The ApplicationContext is a global context provided by the system and is used to access application-level resources and services.

->let me explain the difference between Application and ApplicationContext using the example code provided.

  In the example code, the Database class is a singleton that extends the RoomDatabase class and provides a single method getInstance() that returns the instance of the database.

  When calling the getInstance() method, we need to pass a Context object as a parameter. We have two options for passing a context: application or applicationContext.

  Here's how the two options differ:

  application: This refers to the instance of the Application class that represents the entire application. It's a subclass of Context, so it can be used as a context parameter when creating the Database instance. This context is tied to the lifecycle of the application and is created when the application is launched.
  Example: Database.getInstance(application)

  applicationContext: This refers to the instance of the ApplicationContext class, which is a lightweight context object that provides the same functionality as the Application context. It's also a subclass of Context, so it can be used as a context parameter when creating the Database instance. This context is not tied to the lifecycle of any specific component and is created when the application is launched.
  Example: Database.getInstance(applicationContext)

  So, the main difference between the two is that application is an instance of the Application class that represents the entire application, while applicationContext is an instance of the ApplicationContext class that provides the same functionality in a more lightweight way and is not tied to the lifecycle of any specific component.
  In general, it's recommended to use the ApplicationContext instead of the Application context when creating global singletons in Android, as it avoids potential memory leaks and is more lightweight. However, in certain cases, such as when you need to access the Application object itself, using the application context may be necessary.

  Q.but u said that applicationContext is not tied to any lifecycle then how singleton instance is tied to application lifecycle ?
    I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. You are correct that the ApplicationContext is not tied to the lifecycle of any specific component. However, the singleton instance of the Database class that is created using the ApplicationContext is still tied to the lifecycle of the application itself.
    When we create a singleton instance of the Database class using the ApplicationContext, it means that the instance will be created once and will be available throughout the lifecycle of the application. This singleton instance is tied to the application's lifecycle in the sense that it will be created when the application is launched and destroyed when the application is closed.
    So, to clarify, the ApplicationContext is not tied to any specific component's lifecycle, but the singleton instance of the Database class that is created using the ApplicationContext is tied to the application's lifecycle. This allows us to create a global singleton that can be accessed from any component within the application without worrying about lifecycle issues.
