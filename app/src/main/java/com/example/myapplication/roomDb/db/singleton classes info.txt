Q.Explain and use of singleton class that extent roomDatabase on kotlin
  In Kotlin, a Singleton class is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object. In other words, it ensures that only one instance of a class can be created and provides a global point of access to that instance.

  When it comes to using RoomDatabase in Kotlin, a Singleton class can be used to create a single instance of RoomDatabase that can be shared across the application. This is because creating a new instance of RoomDatabase can be a costly operation, and sharing the same instance can improve performance and reduce resource consumption.

  Here is an example of a Singleton class that extends RoomDatabase in Kotlin:

  @Database(entities = [MyEntity::class], version = 1)
  abstract class MyDatabase : RoomDatabase() {

      abstract fun myDao(): MyDao

      companion object {
          private var INSTANCE: MyDatabase? = null

          fun getInstance(context: Context): MyDatabase {
              if (INSTANCE == null) {
                  synchronized(MyDatabase::class) {
                      INSTANCE = Room.databaseBuilder(context.applicationContext,
                              MyDatabase::class.java, "my_database")
                              .build()
                  }
              }
              return INSTANCE!!
          }
      }
  }

  In this example, MyDatabase is a Singleton class that extends RoomDatabase and defines an abstract method myDao() that returns an instance of MyDao interface.

  The companion object in this class defines a private INSTANCE variable that holds the single instance of MyDatabase. The getInstance() method is a static method that returns the INSTANCE variable after initializing it if it's null. The method is synchronized to prevent multiple threads from accessing the method at the same time, which could result in multiple instances being created.

  To use this Singleton class, you can call getInstance() method on MyDatabase class from any part of the application to get the single instance of MyDatabase:

  val myDatabase = MyDatabase.getInstance(context)
  By using this Singleton class, you can ensure that only one instance of MyDatabase is created and shared across the application, which can improve performance and reduce resource consumption.

Q.Can we use variable myDao to return the instance instead of the function :abstract fun myDao(): MyDao
  No, you cannot use a variable to return the instance of a DAO instead of a function in Room.

  In Room, DAO (Data Access Object) is an interface that defines the database operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying the data. The DAO interface is implemented by Room at compile time, which means Room generates the implementation code for the DAO interface.

  In Kotlin, you cannot directly create an instance of an interface because it does not have a constructor. Therefore, you need to use the abstract fun syntax to define a function that returns an instance of the DAO interface.

  Here is an example of how to define a DAO interface in Room:

  @Dao
  interface MyDao {

      @Insert(onConflict = OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE)
      fun insertData(data: MyData)

      @Query("SELECT * FROM my_data_table")
      fun getAllData(): List<MyData>
  }
  As you can see, the MyDao interface defines two database operations - insertData() and getAllData() - using the @Insert and @Query annotations respectively. You cannot create an instance of this interface directly.

  To use the DAO interface in Room, you need to create an abstract method in the RoomDatabase class that returns an instance of the DAO interface. This method is then implemented by Room at compile time, and you can call it to get an instance of the DAO interface.

  Here is an example of how to define the MyDatabase class that returns an instance of MyDao interface:

  @Database(entities = [MyData::class], version = 1)
  abstract class MyDatabase : RoomDatabase() {

      abstract fun myDao(): MyDao
  }
  As you can see, the MyDatabase class defines an abstract method myDao() that returns an instance of the MyDao interface. You cannot use a variable to return the instance of the DAO instead of this method.

  In summary, you need to define an abstract method that returns the DAO interface in Room because you cannot directly create an instance of an interface.

Q.explain with example ,what is companion object used in above example
  I'll explain the companion object used in the previous example of a Singleton class that extends RoomDatabase.

  A companion object is an object declaration within a class that is used to define a static member of that class. In Kotlin, the companion object can be accessed using the name of the containing class.

  In the example of a Singleton class that extends RoomDatabase, the companion object is used to define a static member INSTANCE of the MyDatabase class. This INSTANCE is a private variable that holds the single instance of MyDatabase.

  Here is the code snippet for the companion object:

  companion object {
      private var INSTANCE: MyDatabase? = null

      fun getInstance(context: Context): MyDatabase {
          if (INSTANCE == null) {
              synchronized(MyDatabase::class) {
                  INSTANCE = Room.databaseBuilder(context.applicationContext,
                          MyDatabase::class.java, "my_database")
                          .build()
              }
          }
          return INSTANCE!!
      }
  }
  As you can see, the companion object is declared inside the MyDatabase class. It defines a private INSTANCE variable that holds the single instance of MyDatabase. It also defines a static method getInstance() that returns the INSTANCE variable after initializing it if it's null.

  The synchronized block is used to make sure that only one thread at a time can access the getInstance() method. If multiple threads try to access the method at the same time, they will be blocked until the current thread finishes executing the method.

  To use the getInstance() method, you can call it on the MyDatabase class from any part of the application:

  val myDatabase = MyDatabase.getInstance(context)
  By using the companion object and the getInstance() method, you can ensure that only one instance of MyDatabase is created and shared across the application. This can improve performance and reduce resource consumption.

  In summary, the companion object in Kotlin is used to define static members of a class, which can be accessed using the name of the containing class. In the example of a Singleton class that extends RoomDatabase, the companion object is used to define a static member INSTANCE of the MyDatabase class and a static method getInstance() that returns the INSTANCE variable after initializing it if it's null.

Q.why we had mad MyDao a interface ,MyDatabase as abstract and myDao function as abstract ,explain it in brief

  In Room, MyDao is an interface, and MyDatabase is an abstract class because they are designed to be implemented by Room at compile-time.

  Here's a brief explanation of why each of these classes is designed the way it is:

  MyDao is an interface because it defines the database operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying the data. An interface is used because it doesn't have any implementation of its own, but defines a set of methods that must be implemented by the concrete class that implements it. Room uses annotations to generate the implementation code for the MyDao interface at compile-time.

  @Dao
  interface MyDao {
      @Insert
      fun insertData(data: MyData)

      @Query("SELECT * FROM my_data_table")
      fun getAllData(): List<MyData>
  }
  MyDatabase is an abstract class because it defines the database schema and provides an abstract method to obtain an instance of the DAO. It also provides a way to get an instance of the database, which is a costly operation, and should be performed only once. The class is abstract because it does not provide the implementation of the myDao() method, which is provided by Room at compile-time.

  @Database(entities = [MyData::class], version = 1)
  abstract class MyDatabase : RoomDatabase() {

      abstract fun myDao(): MyDao

      companion object {
          // implementation of the singleton database instance
      }
  }
  myDao() is an abstract function in the MyDatabase class because it provides an abstract method to obtain an instance of the MyDao interface. The implementation of this method is generated by Room at compile-time, which is why it's marked as abstract.

  @Database(entities = [MyData::class], version = 1)
  abstract class MyDatabase : RoomDatabase() {

      abstract fun myDao(): MyDao
  }
  In summary, Room uses interfaces and abstract classes to provide a flexible and scalable way to define the database schema and database operations. The MyDao interface defines the database operations, the MyDatabase abstract class defines the database schema, and the myDao() method provides an abstract way to obtain an instance of the DAO interface. Room then generates the implementation code for these classes at compile-time, which makes it easy to use and maintain.
